It\u2019s about believing in yourself, investing in your health, and sticking to your commitments.\n\nIt works. Since 2013 dietbetters have lost over 2 million pounds. Along the way, we\u2019ve paid out $10 million to winners.\n\nOur Chief Scientist is at Brown Medical School and with her we're integrating evidence-based practices. We also work with top health and wellness influencers: Jillian Michaels, Chris Powell, Tim Ferriss, and many more.\n\nThe best part is that we succeed when our users do.

We all know that technology can do more.\n\nThe way we see it, the solution isn't data. It's inspiration. It's about hauling yourself out of bed on a rainy morning to jog, or passing up the cupcakes someone just set down next to your desk. That's where the real battles are won (or lost).\n\nYou have a 7+ year track record of making engaging consumer apps from end to end (ideally games). \n\nYou should have a technical background, even if your coding is rusty. \n\nYou know how to wireframe and are familiar with the tools of the trade. \n\nYou're extremely mobile savvy.\n\nYou should love interacting with customers.\n\nYou should have experience hiring and managing since you'll be building your own team from scratch (designers, product managers, developers).\n\nFinally, you should have a passion for the science around habit modification, behavioral economics, game design, and fun theory.\n\nWe're gazing out the window and we just know you're out there.
